1.  A script I run which calculates the expected points each player will contribute over the next n gameweeks.
    Can put captain on the player with the most expected points each gameweeks. Good way to identify weakness.
    Could also look at impact of hypothetical transfers. What is the best transfer(s) I could make today?
2.  Think about how I can include the other ways of making or lossing points in my expected points model. Bonus is a key thing.
    I guess each bonus (3,2,1) should be allocated with some probability to each player. 
3.  Think about how to display the player data
4.  Can I approve which players are playing or not rahter than relying on the scrape? Could bould a NN perhaps. 
5.  Double gemweeks is not taken into account in the expected points model
